# 🌐 Frontend Clone Projects (HTML & CSS)

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains two **frontend clone projects** built using pure HTML & CSS:

* 🛒 **Amazon Clone** – A landing page inspired by Amazon’s UI.
* 🎬 **Netflix India Clone** – A landing page inspired by Netflix India.

Both projects were created as part of my web development practice to strengthen fundamentals in HTML structure, CSS styling, flexbox layouts, and responsive design.
